1) Made for Python.
2) Requires "pip install selenium".
3) Place as many addresses as you want to be tested in the "check.txt" file, one per line without errors or syntax mistakes.
4) Tests batches of 400 addresses at a time; more than this, the website where the checker pulls data from blocks.
5) I haven't tried making it work in headless mode.
6) Make good use of it!
